# Conway's Game of Life
**Simulating [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) recreated using [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)**

## Run Instructions
I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to run this simulation.

In the root directory, run the following commands:
```sh
> python -m venv venv

> venv\Scripts\activate

> pip install -r requirements.txt

> python main.py
```
